# Unity Editor Installer for Linux

Bash script to grab any Unity archive for Linux.

I made this after growing frustrated with Unity's [archive page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) not providing any links for Linux installations, and for teaching myself how to write in bash script.

## Running

Simply run `./unitydownload.sh`, and search for a specific unity version that you would like to download, and it will install the specific UnitySetup.AppImage for that version. You can exit by typing in "exit" when prompted to search or by pressing Ctrl+C at any time.
