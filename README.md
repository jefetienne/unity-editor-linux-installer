# Unity Editor Installer for Linux

Bash script to grab any Unity archive for Linux.

Simply run `./unitydownload.sh`, and search for a specific unity version that you want, and it will automatically install the specific UnitySetup.AppImage for that app version. You can exit by typing in "exit" when prompted to search or by pressing Ctrl+C at any time.

TODO:
- Better filtering for search results
- Choose directory to download into
