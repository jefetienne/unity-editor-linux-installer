# Unity Editor Installer for Linux

Bash script to grab any Unity archive for Linux.

Simply run `./unitydownload.sh`, and search for a specific unity version that you want, and it will automatically install the specific UnitySetup.AppImage for that app version.

TODO:
- Better filtering for search results
- Choose directory to download into
